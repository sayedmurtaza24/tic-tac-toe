# Tic Tac Toe

## About
This is an assignment project I did for [Peltarion](https://peltarion.com) and the goal of the project
was to use HTML, CSS, Javascript and NodeJS only (no external libraries) for it to work. The project
has a client and a server side and the game is as simple as 1. hosting a game 2. sharing the link to
the other player 3. well...., and play!

## Demo
The project is up and running and you can visit it through this link => [Play Tic Tac Toe](https://tic-tac-doe.herokuapp.com/)

## How it works?
It uses:
* A NodeJS server to serve the game
* Http long pooling technic to connect the client and server
* A very simple json to filesystem datastore system to make it persistent

Although being open source and free to copy, __this project shall never be used as assignment project
for Peltarion.__
